# nvimpam

The beginning of a neovim rpc plugin for pamcrash files. Based on
[neovim-scorched-earth](https://github.com/boxofrox/neovim-scorched-earth).

Uses [daa84/neovim-lib](https://github.com/daa84/neovim-lib), a slightly
modified copy is included. Uses https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/5269, so
building a patched neovim is necessary (I might include the sources and a script
for ease-of-testing later).
