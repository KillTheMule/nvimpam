## Contributing

I'd love contributions, comments, praise, criticism... You could open an [issue](https://github.com/KillTheMule/nvimpam/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/KillTheMule/nvimpam/pulls), or if you want a direct contact, meet me in the [neovim gitter channel](https://gitter.im/neovim/neovim). I also read the subreddits for [rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/) and [neovim](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/), if that suits you better.
